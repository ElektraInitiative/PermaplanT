# Contributing

If you are new, it is probably best if you first [write us](mailto:contact@permaplant.net).

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/) to maintain this initiative.

Before you start working on anything, please make sure you have [pre-commit hooks](../doc/contrib/README.md#Hooks) set up.

For any non-trival work, i.e. not only updates in docu or tests, there should be an underlying issue.
You can create such issues yourself.
Make sure the issue is:

- assigned to you and
- ["In Progress" in our project](https://github.com/orgs/ElektraInitiative/projects/4).

Once you created a PR, please request reviews, including also from @markus2330, who will usually also merge.

Commit messages:

- The first line in commit messages should be short.
- From the third line you can have more elaborate descriptions of the changes.
- Please refer to #issues/#PRs/@mention as useful.

Branch names:

- feature/<issue_nr>
- bug_fix/<issue_nr>
- documentation/<name>
- meeting_notes/<date>

If requested, and in any case before you start making fundamental changes, create a [decision](/doc/decisions/) before creating a code PR.
