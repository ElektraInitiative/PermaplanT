# Contributing

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/) to maintain this initiative.

For any non-trival work, i.e. not only updates in docu or tests, there should be an underlying issue.
Make sure the issue is:

- assigned to you and
- ["In Progress" in our project](https://github.com/orgs/ElektraInitiative/projects/4).

Once you created a PR, please request a review from @markus2330, who will also merge.

The first line in commit messages should be short.
From the third line you can have more elaborate descriptions of the changes.
Please refer to #issues/#PRs/@mention as useful.

Branch names:

- feature/<issue_nr>
- bug_fix/<issue_nr>
- documentation/<name>
- meeting/<date>

If requested, and in any case before you start making fundamental changes, create a [decision](/doc/decisions/) before creating a code PR.
