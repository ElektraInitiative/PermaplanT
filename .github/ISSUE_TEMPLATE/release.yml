        ### Prep for Release

        - [ ] [Finish release critical task](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/milestone/)
        - [ ] fix _real_ security problems
              unfortunately `npm audit --omit=dev fix` does [too much and too little](https://overreacted.io/npm-audit-broken-by-design/),
              `cargo deny check` seems to be more helpful
        - [ ] check/improve reformatting
        - [ ] check if all issues labelled `release critical` are fixed
        - [ ] update mergedDatasets.csv
        - [ ] Merge PRs (@markus2330)

        ### Actual Release

        - [ ] check if all preps are done
        - [ ] manually test dev.permaplant.net according to protocol
        - [ ] build <https://build.libelektra.org/job/PermaplanT-Release/>
        - [ ] git tag -s vX.X.X
        - [ ] git push --tags
        - [ ] create release PR to pump versions and new section in Changelog
        - [ ] write announcement
