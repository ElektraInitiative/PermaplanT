## Meeting Notes

Four team members finished their thesis.

Topic for buddies this week: research questions.
Common mistakes in English text:
mood changers: "on the other hand" is only used in whole phrases i.e. "on the one hand -> on the other hand".
Use "But", "However" or paragraphs to indicate mood changes.

Open Source and Free Software is not quite the same:

- Free Software has its focus on free as-in-speech software+development (see FSF/Richard Stallman).
- Open-Source Software has its focus on practical utility and advantages of free licenses in software+development (see OSI).
- FLOSS, which contains both Free Software and Open-Source Software in its name, is the preferred term in scientific texts.

Shorthands: spell out the first time it is used e.g.: Free Software Foundation (FSF).

Project/Initiative: Project has a deadline, Initiatives do not.

"Figure~X" is always spelled with an Initial capital letter when it used for referencing a specific figure "X".
