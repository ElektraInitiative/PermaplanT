## Meeting Notes

Four team members finished their theseis.

Topic for budies this week: research questions.
Common mistakes in english text:
mood changers: "on the other hand" is only used in whole phrases eith "on the one hand -> on the other hand". Use "But"/However or paragraphs instead.

Open Source and Free Software is not quite the same. Free Sotware is developed "freely" with a strong ideology behind it (see FSF/Richard Stallman).
Open Source Software uses more liberal licences and usualy is less politically involved. For this reason it is the preferred way of software development in science.

Shorthands: spell out the first time it is used e.g.: Free Software Foundation (FSF).

Project/Initiative: Project has a deadline, Initiatives do not.

"Figure" is always spelled with an inital capital letter when it used for referencing a figure.
