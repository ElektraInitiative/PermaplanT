## Agenda:

- welcome ☺️
- architecture:
  - quality goals:
    1. stability
    2. maintenance
    3. performance
    4. privacy
  - which modules do we have?
    - modules ~ endpoints, so it is map, users, ...
  - where to add which code, e.g.:
    - polyculture algorithms -> subfolder in services (documentation will be written)
    - switching of layer/time -> parameters to endpoint
    - session handling -> nextcloud (OAuth client lib), token only in browser, not in backend or DB, open decision: best Rust OAuth Client (https://auth0.com/blog/build-an-api-in-rust-with-jwt-authentication-using-actix-web/)
    - transaction handling -> not needed
    - threading -> tokio
    - regular tasks (see decision below) -> Rust/tokio if easy, otherwise cronjob
    - validation -> done by diesel
    - reporting/monitoring tool
  - solution strategy?
    - description of 3 layers
    - types/structs
    - diesel/rust intro in docs(Gabriel)
    - be stateless (all state in DB)
- documentation:
  1. mdBook (general intro)
  2. API documentation (swagger?)
  3. code documentation of backend
  4. code documentation of frontend
- to work with DB -> Diesel must be learned
- which decisions do we need to make?
  - API documentation
    - https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/pull/101
    - typescript generation of openapi?
  - DB documentation
    - https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/97 -> yes, we document the structs
    - what about SQL queries?
    - open decision: best Rust OAuth Client/Server
  - regular tasks https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/pull/130
- which tasks do we have?
  - logging decision
  - extend pre-commit hook for backend (Benjamin)
  - cargo watch (Gabriel)
- who wants to work on which task?
- Gabriel: mdBook, API docu
- Benjamin: pre-commit hook, review mdBook, API frontend
- Nursultan: documenting structs
- Ramzan: Diesel Postgis, check how to document algorithm
