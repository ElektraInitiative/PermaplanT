- calculate/evaluate performance:
  - pest controls/attractive wild life/...
- why game:
  - put in parallel scenarios simultan
  - lead to very different path way
  - peer discussion
  - peer experts help in assessment
  - ranking (e.g. peer review happened)
- Use cases
  - known companions evaluated by growers (placement, constraints, preferences)
  - growers have a list about 80 vegetables
  - planning done by experts (maybe even same)
  - work together
  - output (harvest, measurement kits for soil, e.g. water measurements, taste)
  - "citicen science"
  - e.g. 10 growers with different combinations
  - harvest basket/Erntekörbchen (to facilitate more diverse gardens and community work):
    - get good reviews in added plants
    - write good reviews (known companions and traits-based)
    - get good reviews when helping other people in their map
    - get good reviews of your own map
    - get new people apply for membership
    - good plant diversity, reward:
      - have the ingredients you need the whole year round (e.g. for a smoothie)
      - have at least 3 plants blooming simultaneously
      - plan a garden with given constraints (probably best doable if you can give others permissions to draw on alternative **layers**)
      - have all vegetables you need for a party at date X

Next meeting in around 3 weeks with use cases and mockups.
