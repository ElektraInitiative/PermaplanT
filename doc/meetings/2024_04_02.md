## Meeting Notes

Filip maybe does not need to attend the meeting every week. This is to be decided on with him.

The repository will be migrated to the TU Wien Gitlab and later maybe to a self hosted instance which then also can be public.

The release should be done in the next days because it is already overdue. Filip should be a part of it to get a first insight.

Andrei will be starting creating issues from case studies. Before that he will create issues for everyone's tasks discussed in the meeting. The reviewing of PRs will be staying the same for another week before a new protocol is established.

To be able to add other layers backend migration needs to be done once the frontend supports it.

The bug that causes the timeline not to be selected in the centered element after resizing the y-axis on the map page is not release critical and therefore is not fixed right now.

The heatmap can not be merged to master yet because it is semantically incorrect but the refactoring can more easily be done after merging the heatmap into master.

Branches are lately getting too big which comes from bad management and problems in communication (talking about blockers!). Issues need to be broken down to be solved in one week and not be too big and cause many merge conflicts after finishing them.

Investigation should be done by Moritz to find out what should stay a layer and what should become a group.

A seperate meeting will be held to discuss crop rotation implementations and research.
