## Meeting Notes

Feedback: - same/conflicting information at different locations

Project:
Look at new PR courses: 194.145 and 194.146
Project is work hour focused

What should be in PR what in follow up issues: - code quality issues or missing documentation in PR - functional extensions can be in follow up issues
Guideline: repository should be in a better state after each PR

Write issues with specification before starting to work on it.
Update issue description and ask if it is still correct/relevant before starting to work on it.

Hierarchy Implementation Proposal accepted.

Hierarchy extension: Plant icon name in database for different hierarchy levels.
Frontend gets the icon name it should request from Nextcloud.
