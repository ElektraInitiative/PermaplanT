## Meeting Notes

- Typical erros when writing the thesis are summarized in unterlagen/english.md

### Milestones

- should be different from the weekly plan
- cornerstones should be listed like results and methods
- consider a buffer due to occurences of unexpected problems
- less milestones preferable
- adi's experience: biggest effort was in the beginning finding the RQs and in the end revising the whole thesis
- most important thing is to regularly be busy with the thesis and implementation
- closing PRs is always very important
- creating new leftovers from existing PRs (instead of squeezing it in) helps to finish existing PRs

### Architecture and Decisions

- important to identify the main components of an application/system and differentiate from details like interfaces
- decisions regarding architecture are essential
- solutions and guidelines is something which needs constant adaptations

### General

- Release critical issues and PRs have highest priority
- General guideline is to first finish things instead of opening new stuff

### Current issues

#### Frontend Restructuring

- try to move svg's into src/icons folder and see how it goes
- in case there is a location problem with e.g. the favicon, it is okay to have single icons in the public folder

#### Seed Search

- (markus + yvonne) discuss and find a solution on how to best present and potentially combine the plant- and seed-search
- seeds have no physical size, can be a literal seed but also a full plant; seeds simply resemble the genetical material of a plant
