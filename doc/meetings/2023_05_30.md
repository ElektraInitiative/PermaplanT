## Changelogs

**Please push progress important changes devs should know, e.g. decisions, in items with syntax `- change _(Your Name)_` below:**

**Auth:**

- now active, requires either a user on https://auth.permaplant.net/ (can be aquired by visiting https://pr.permaplant.net/, clicking login and register) or a local setup of Keycloak (see readme in backend)
- doc on how to obtain tokens for local development is still missing (e.g. OAuth2 via Postman or curl) #392
- local swagger doc broken (tracked by #383)

**Nextcloud:**

- introduced webdav library
- introduced utility functions for fetching and uploading images to Nextcloud as well as a webdav test component (webdav-test.tsx) for testing this functionality.
  It is currently available at /webdav
- disable CORS in your browser for Nextcloud feature development:
  e.g. `google-chrome --disable-web-security` or `chromium --disable-web-security`
  This is needed to allow requests which are not under the some origin.
  More info about Nextcloud setup in /doc/setups/nextcloud/README.md

**map state management:**

The state is now split in two parts namely tracked and untracked map store.
More info about the state management of layers in the map editor is available in /doc/architecture/frontend.md

**general:**

- finish last decisions https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/2
