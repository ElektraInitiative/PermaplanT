## Meeting Notes

Thorben User-Study:

- Introduction
- Explain Layers

  - Base Layer

  - Plant Layer (including explanation of seeds, maybe undo-redo, maybe toolbar instead)

Read `doc/usecases/README.md`.

- Usecase is done iff it includes documentation, closed issues, changelog, test protocol (with links from usecase to testprotocol), moved to 'done'

Testing protocol

- New tests should be added to `doc/tests/manual/protocol.md`
- Tests in `protocol.md` should be simple and short
- When tests are executed (e.g before release) create a new report in `doc/tests/manual/reports`
- Write a report (in`manual/reports`) about your test cases.
- Reports can include more detailed explanations
