## Meeting Notes

Next meeting in 2 weeks
Next release in 3 weeks
Andrei will give his presentation in 2 weeks

Markus did a short presentation about his current research topic 'configuration', also in the context of Elektra and PermaplanT
It's important for presentations and our thesis to present a domain specific question in the context of our scientific topic

Everyone should do a short presentation (2-3min, 2-3 slides) to introduce themselves and show the others what they are working on. The presentation should cover three short topics. Topics could be about your research questions or some benchmark.
Everyone should use permaplant for your use case, e.g. plan your garden.

Reminder that it would be great if everyone could give demos from time to time.

Relation layer and heatmap show misconfigurations. Considering other plants and environmental factors (hydrology, soil, etc.). Icons and text will describe relations in the relation layer, e.g. "Spinach should not be planted after spinach" (crop rotation).

Socratic questioning: While reviewing the research question PRs for each review take at least two socratic questions (see unterlagen/socratic_questioning.md)

Lukas talked about the Brush feature. The brush drawing would need to be saved pixel-by-pixel to make it work like in paint.

In the future bug fixes should target master other developement should target the dev branch
