# Meeting 2023-02-17

https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/37#issuecomment-1433926689

## Questions from Lukas and Markus:

1. Should we pin the rust version in any way, or is it ok to always use the latest version?
   - we use Rust version 1.67.1 (2023-02-09), [see decision](/doc/decisions/backend_programming_language.md)
2. How should we handle the situation during build? (no Postgres, etc.)
   - the build will simply fail
3. How do we inject the correct `BASE_URL` for the backend into the frontend?

   - .env file (will be solved with #49)

## Meeting notes:

Updates from Markus:

- there should be easy ways to indicate areas of interest, e.g. by crosshatching areas which do not have a dedicated symbol in the landscape layer
- gardens of various sizes for beta testing
- Yvonne started drawing for PermaplanT
- Next Friday set milestones with final dates

Discussions:

- Deployment in react https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/
- Both deployment methods are equal from our point of view. /api proxy vs static port
- treffle.io is a big database but is lacking vital information for common gardening plants
- Diesel needs a database even on compile time
- 3 independent LXC containers for PRs, master and releases [see issue](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/53)
- Check out the problem with Diesel https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/37#issuecomment-1433926689 @aidnurs
