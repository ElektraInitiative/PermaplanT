## Meeting Notes

- Search does not work with full names => currently not urgent
- difference between method and methodology not relevant for us
- PR should be short-lived because they affect others, timeframe of one week, bundle suggestions logically or by reviewer
- feature requests / new ideas in PRs:

  - userstory / idea not clear before implementations
  - not every question in a request for the current PR
  - bigger changes in follow-up PR

- Use Socratic Questioning to improve research questions
- selection vastly improved
-
