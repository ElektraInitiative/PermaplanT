## Meeting Notes

Layer state management is the most complex aspect of the PermaPlanT frontend right now due to the collaboration feature.

Copy&Paste collaboration feature is too complex as just another use case => needs to be split up.

Number of layers restricted by library konva, they recommend only a few (4-5) layers. This is a problem before we add more layers. Konva does offer groups with simillar API to layers. Issue #952
