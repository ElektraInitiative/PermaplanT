# Meeting 2023-04-07 DB

_Protocolled by: Nursultan_

## Attendees

- Nursultan
- Moritz
- Benjamin
- Thorben
- Ramzan
- Paul
- Markus
- (everyone on the mailing list is welcomed)

## Preparations

1. given all the use cases, how should the tables for a map look like?
2. think about how we do the plants hierarchy (that plants from lower ranks inherit attributes from higher ranks, e.g. the specific Tomato  https://www.reinsaat.at/shop/DE/tomaten_paradeiser/cocktailtomate/anabelle/ should contain all the data the general Tomato https://permapeople.org/plants/solanum-lycopersicum-tomato has, but without duplicating this data, see also https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/blob/master/doc/decisions/database_structure.md for current status

Please make a sketch or similar of the tables.

Furthermore, following individual tasks as preparation:

- Moritz: focus on question 2. of above
- Nursultan: results of feasibility (which data of canvas needs to be stored in DB etc.)
- Benjamin: look at how we do the plants hierarchy (that plants from lower ranks inherit what higher ranks have)
- Ramzan: Which PostGIS datatypes will we use for 2D/3D points? Focus on question 1. of above
- Thorben: ER/SQL for users and maps
- Paul: how to sync map data for offline use
