# Meeting 2023-04-07 DB

_Protocolled by: Nursultan_

## Attendees

- Nursultan
- Moritz
- Benjamin
- Thorben
- Ramzan
- Paul
- Markus
- Luciano
- Yvonne
- (everyone on the mailing list is welcomed)

## Preparations

1. given all the use cases, how should the tables for a map look like?
2. think about how we do the plants hierarchy (that plants from lower ranks inherit attributes from higher ranks, e.g. the specific Tomato  https://www.reinsaat.at/shop/DE/tomaten_paradeiser/cocktailtomate/anabelle/ should contain all the data the general Tomato https://permapeople.org/plants/solanum-lycopersicum-tomato has, but without duplicating this data, see also https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/blob/master/doc/decisions/database_structure.md for current status

Please make a sketch or similar of the tables.

Furthermore, following individual tasks as preparation:

- Moritz: focus on question 2. of above
- Nursultan: results of feasibility (which data of canvas needs to be stored in DB etc.)
- Benjamin: look at how we do the plants hierarchy (that plants from lower ranks inherit what higher ranks have)
- Ramzan: Which PostGIS datatypes will we use for 2D/3D points? Focus on question 1. of above
- Thorben: ER/SQL for users and maps
- Paul: how to sync map data for offline use

## New Tasks

- Yvonne: latin name is unique
- Benjamin: plant hierachy, relationship
- Moritz: latin_name rename
- Nursultan: plant DB names i.e. scrapers
- Paul:
- Ramzan: rest DB
- Thorben: rest DB

## Previous Tasks

- Nursultan:
  - DB Design
  - feasibility study
    - undo in DB
    - canvas zoom
    - what coordinates we have in the canvas? e.g. zoom-in
    - differences between databases
  - permapeople.org https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/102
  - reinsaat.at https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/123
- Ramzan:
  - guidelines
    - singular vs. plural
    - varchar vs. text
  - layers/alternatives/time support in DB (together with Nursultan)
  - continue researching/discovering PostGIS e.g. projection algorithms
- Moritz:
  - connect plants with seeds (together with Paul)
  - handover of scraper tasks
- Thorben:
  - create ER/SQL for users and maps tables (coordinate with Samuel)
- Benjamin:
  - continue investigation in polyculture task

## Agenda

- 14:00 start
- welcome ☺️
- goals:
  - stable migrations
  - maintenance
  - performance
- DB Design
- scraper/new columns:
  - permapeople.org https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/102
  - reinsaat.at https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/123
- which important decisions do we need to make?
  - plant relations: https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/pull/89
  - undo
  - alternatives
  - singular vs. plural
  - ?
- who wants to work on which task?

## Notes

- Thorben presented the map
    - re-check the requirements

- coordinates in the database
    - can use different coordinate systems. but costly
    - kepler.gl can use lang/lat coordinate systems
    - LeafletJS
    - KonvaJS
- cartesian vs lang/lat coordinates
- balance between separate tables for each canvas object in the database vs. one table for the whole map as a stringified JSON
- PostGIS can store raster information in the database
    - user can brush to draw raster areas
