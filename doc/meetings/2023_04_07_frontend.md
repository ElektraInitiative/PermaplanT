## Meeting Notes

- translation
  - it is hard to remember to keep the file structure in the language the same as the features:
    - maybe colocate the json to the component -> hard to implement
  - language switcher as a dropdown
- landing page https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/pull/226
  - logo and slogan should use the same colors
  - legal issue, should the map be loaded immediatly
  - clicking on the radio button is hard -> click on the whole row to select
  - the slogan grows to both the left and the right -> Make it left aligned with fixed width
    layers/sidebar prototype
  - transparency slider is not html 5 but from scratch -> look into usability
  - the seperator between the layers and groups/search should also be draggable/resizable
  - tooltips for the eye symbol and enable checkbox instead of labels
  - for alternatives, a caret to expand
  - buttons on the top right would be too small for touchscreens
  - four groups should be hidden if search is pressed
- timeline mockups https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/pull/238
  - should custom events be in the timeline as a seperate view -> no, only addition and removal
  - only visualize changes that actually happen on the map, addition/removal by the user
  - is this too complex to implelement -> look for existing solutions
  - simplifications we discussed
    - do not show individual events (color or number should indicate the amount of change)
    - only three steps of granularity, maybe even with a button group
- drawing layer https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/pull/215
  - how are we structuring the layer code -> each layer should live under a layers folder in map_planning
  - shared features like plat_search should have their own feature folder
- seed entry current status https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/209
  - edit and removal of seeds

- Giancarlo: seed overview (edit, delete, ...), code structure documentation
- Paul: seed fix, i18n
- Samuel: typewriter, toolbar improvements, pricing selection (add to email body)
- Thorben: leaf picture color, blue color consistency, imprint, pricing
