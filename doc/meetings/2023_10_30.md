## Meeting Notes

### TODOs for upcoming release

- Fix plant naming
- Various usability improvements

### Misc

- UI/Usability guideline:

  - reviews
  - guidelines not set in stone
  - need to be constantly adapted and enhanced

- Keybindings:

  - try to reduce to 2 layers max: top level (global, layers, etc.) and second level (actions)
  - developer info section (top level) for shortcuts which should never be customized

- Layers vs Groups:
  - performance-wise no difference at page load (a few milliseconds)
  - tested with a few thousands nodes
  - tendentially better performance with groups (~50ms)
  - functionality still working
  - future plan: test with many more layers
  - conclusion: (more than likely) go with groups
