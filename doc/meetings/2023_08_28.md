## Meeting Notes

- buddy-meeting regarding RQs
- communication via Nextcloud (markus and yvonne are there) or via discord who wants to
- case study: mention in the contributions that we actually used the software for something real (e.g. a plant bed in case of PermaplanT) and not just used it randomly "for fun"

- updated **changelog.md** now has to be part of **every PR**

- Felix: use a picture of the set-up hardware and add it to the thesis

- Christoph: add decision regarding test strategy for the frontend, especially integration testing

- Jannis: keycloak registration (with real name)

- Christoph+Jannis: add title and working abstract for TISS

- OpenSesame: things that are not statically testable have to be reviewed and manually checked

## How to get text to paper

### Use **Free Writing** as a method

- write by hand
- reserve a timeslot (like 10-20min) and set a countdown
- most important thing is to continuously write during this period and to not delete (strike-through) anything, just continue to write
- usually trying to write grammatically correct sentences is often hindering and can anyway be done afterwards (also automatically by tools)
- do not write result-oriented; usually a few ideas exist afterwards anyway, though that's not the main goal of this method
- this is a technique purely to get text to paper and not to find a research question

- **Task** till next meeting: try out "Free Writing" and talk about it
