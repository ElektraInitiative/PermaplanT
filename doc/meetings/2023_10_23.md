## Agenda

- Protocol: Daniel
- Felix finished!
- praise:
  - great questions by everyone
  - excellent reviews by Christoph
- empty plant menus:
  - Do we wanna inform the user when he has no seeds, as we do now (in prod)?
  - Do we wanna offer him the possibility, via some action link, to go directly to the seeds page to create some, as we do now (in prod)?
- improving communication: issues describing what you want to do
- event handling:
  - Where to bind keylisteners (especially for konva layers)?
- framework scope
- focus -> standard
- forms?
  - Should we type available keys and actions (enums?, constants?)?
  - Do we want to use https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hotkeys-hook? -> rather not, concept first
- reihenfolge: #1000 merge?
- nicht zu sehr auf esc

## Meeting Notes

permaculture principles examples: - Yvonne: composting can be accelerated by higher temperature; efficient distances - Markus: speak about details to define clear issues; use time and personal energy efficiently - Adi: automation (pipelines, tests) - Christoph: push every day - Moritz: keep on working every day

event handling discussion - we use one single json (source of truth) for keybindings (Actions as key and shortcuts as value) - in keyhandlers for konva it has to be checked if corresponding layer is active - html element should be passed to hook - Daniel will update decision

layers vs groups - nothing done yet

design guidlines

    - if rules are broken a comment should be added that explains de decision
