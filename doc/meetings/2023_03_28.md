## Agenda

- 09:00 welcome
- Questions:
  - buddy talk: what is your case study? (use PermaplanT yourself)
  - GitHub+NC notifications enabled?
  - How many PRs did you review?
  - Interesting usecases?
- In the future I see PermaplanT as ...
- [Project](https://github.com/orgs/ElektraInitiative/projects/4/): Planning for next iteration
- English:
  - hyphen: up-to-date topic, highly-interactive app, vs. the app is highly interactive
  - terms always the same (Glossary!)
  - when writing, look up grammar rules etc.
  - for verbs search for synonyms
- getting better meeting notes
  - always push to agenda what affects others (decisions, documentation, hooks, ...)
- Tips for your thesis:
  - Forschungstagebuch
  - speed
  - look at other thesis
  - identify glossary terms with italics
  - implementation details, make it shorter
  - lessons learned are nice
  - evaluation is must-have (how do we answer RQ. only results, without any opinion)
- working together
  - common components (SimpleButton improvement PR)
  - benchmark setups
  - code
  - minimize work on thesis
- technicalities:
  - PRs with generic issues (use cases #1, decisions #2), don't need extra issues just for the PR
  - make sure PRs have README.md (short description in GitHub)
  - branch names see .github/CONTRIBUTING.md
  - merging policy: own PRs should not be merged by yourself, others are okay if you are sure it is okay and it solves a problem for you (e.g. fixes builds).
- paper
  - how to write methodology
  - what is important for RQs
- outcome of backend meeting:
  - we want to use Swagger
  - decisions: prefer to simply push and consider all possible solutions even if it is obvious
- assignment of one use cases
- 2nd milestone
  - we should be able to plant plants

## Questions

- Samuel
  - When are PRs merged?
  - How to avoid duplicate effort?
    E.g. I am working on simple components that I need for my feature other people might need similar components for different feature.
    Should we create smaller PRs that get merged fast? E.g. SimpleButton improvement PR
- Moritz
  - Is there already a standard format for branch names and commit messages?
- Benjamin
  - Is the current state of the database schema on master fixed or subject to change?
