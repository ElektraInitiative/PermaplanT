## Meeting Notes

We will apply for [netidee funding](https://www.netidee.at/).
If interested write an email to Markus&Yvonne.
If necessary, we will have a meeting to further discuss details.
Needed for application is a 15 second video per person, to see each team member in the team.

Migration to GitLab: everyone can log in and play around already.
This week are all Issues & PRs still in Github.

Release: only small bugs missing.

In future we will have two main branches:

- `master`: stable branch for releases (mostly bug fixes)
- `dev`: development branch (bigger features, most things)

The small feature branches stay the same and usually have the dev branch as target

- When creating PRs: Link to issue and add small summaries to PRs to help Reviewers
- When doing reviews: mention what you did as reviewer.

Individual tasks (also see above):

- Andrei: part of the meetings for Reviews to make working together more efficient in near future.
- Lukas proposition: clean up the branches, that are stale and not of use anymore.
- Layers: Small refactorings and features can be done in parallel, and refactoring and doc is positive. Daniel organizes meeting about this.

Tasks for everyone (see above):

- Fill up submission repository.
- For this week do README.md.
- Next week TISS.txt.
