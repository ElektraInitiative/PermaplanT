## Meeting Notes

### Principles:

- "Get a yield": extract positives for oneself
- "Design form patterns to details": start in general and focus on details later
- Daniel: Minimal Viable Product: product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle
- Christoph: told example that he focused on font size in ER diagrams to much and lost focus on the whole.
- Jannis: found solution to implement transactions in Diesel -> a great yield

### Technical Part:

- Jannis finished planting note PR
- we should try to create small PRs
- Markus creates security guidelines that have to be reviewed after completion.
- In reviews, we should write down what we focused on.
