## Meeting Notes

Idea: apply for [found](https://www.netidee.at/) with PermaplanT. One meeting to think about how we apply. Would be 60 a second video per person, to see each team member in the team. If interested write an email.
Migration to GitLab: everyone can log in already. This week Issues & PRs in Github.
Release: only small bugs missing.
Two branches for future: stable master branches with releases (just small bug fixes) + development branch (bigger features, most things) (+ small feature branches stay the same and merge into dev branch)
Andrei: part of the meetings for Reviews to make working together more efficient in near future.
PR: Add small summaries to PRs to help Reviewers, also mention what you did as Reviewer.
Lukas proposition: clean up the branches, that are stale and not of use anymore.
Fill up submission repository. For this week do README.md. Next week TISS.txt.
Layers: Small refactorings and features can be done in parallel, and refactoring and doc is positive. Daniel organizes meeting about this.
