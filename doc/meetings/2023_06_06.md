## Agenda

- 09:00 welcome
- welcome Christoph (DB, Nextcloud, Security)
- permaculture principles part III
- protocol: Samuel
- FLOSS
  - tutor
  - issues
- issues which are handled by students in the next semester (should be simple and concise)
- excellent specification is valued as almost done
- good first issue label (will be renamed to FLOSS)
- break
- coordination
  - responsibility to implement use cases fully (or ask if you think implementation needs intermediate steps)
  - pulling in of libs (zod): write about it in decisions or in [solution](../architecture/04solution.md)
- problems with typeshare:
  no validation -> zod as validation library to solve this
- no error when types are mismatching
- write a few sentences in solutions for the use cases of zod
- grading:
  - 10, 20, 70
  - 10: thesis is smallest task but has to be done
  - 20: review and help the team
  - 70: implementation / individual work for the project
  - quality before quantity
  - important and urgent tasks
  - self-written/initial use cases/goals are not important
- use cases update

try the best to finish the thesis until end of june, in the worst case it can take a little longer

- DB layout
  - if (and when) it was fully done
    no responsible person until now -> Christophs topic now
- 18.6. live meeting
- open questions
  - icons
  - avoiding float: roundig? could lead to visual glitches. We would prefer integers
  - state: year->objects
    idea: group objects acording to visible and invisible and return both from the api.
    the visibility is calculated using the start_date and end_date of the elements.
    same calculation happens when the timeline is used in the frontend
- Changelogs
- [sprint plan](https://github.com/orgs/ElektraInitiative/projects/4/)
- outlook

## Changelogs

**Please push progress important changes devs should know, e.g. decisions, in items with syntax `- change _(Your Name)_` below:**

db schemata are merged but might have to be reworked when implementing the gamification use cases

plant search fixes: - no results when clicking search fixed - search was too sensitive - search splits query in substrings and ranks the results given substring matches

use case for full text search should be changed according to current implementation

missing german names: good example of first issue

use priority sorter in jenkins

documentation of architecture

new Nextcloud instance is done
