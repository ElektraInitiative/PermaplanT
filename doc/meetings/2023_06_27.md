- Nextcloud image gallery including Nextcloud image components for unauthenticated and authenticated use, Nextcloud utilites for fetching data from Nextcloud public share _(Samuel)_
- most of discussed UI/UX improvements done: disabled icons, tooltips for buttons in left bar, tooltips for plants, images for plants, notification border color, select one plant of selection for attribute editor (needs some polishing still) _(Paul and Samuel)_
- Fetch corresponding layer IDs of a map during initialization of the map editor _(Paul and Thorben)_
- Use the correct layer ID for create and fetch actions (for plantings) in the map editor, enabling the possibility for multiple independent maps _(Paul and Thorben)_
- Location picker map in map creation form only loads after actively pressing a button _(Thorben)_
- Maps can be duplicated from the map overview (in PR #515) _(Thorben)_

## Meeting Notes

short game with statements about other team members
thesis should be done at the latest until august (end of term)

UI improvements:
tooltip should be bigger and not overlap the mouse cursor (ideally -> scale dependent)
tooltip does not work if plant is selected
icons for plants
debug grid (every 10 cm a point or fine line)
change plant default size (30 cm)
slider handle maybe more prominent? (vertical dots)

adi will look at the test strategy

    important use cases should be tested end-to-end (move plant, add plant, ...)

first e2e test (plant search and check results)

thesis:

    free writing: write per hand what comes into mind -> refactor

changelog:
in its own file? -> yes (commit together with the PR)

readme in submissions:
specify final deadline (latest 31 august)
list all tasks to finish thesis
