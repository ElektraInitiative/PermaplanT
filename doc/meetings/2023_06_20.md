## Meeting Notes

- Recap of first in person meeting
- Usability improvements for first beta/usability test:

  - hide unused toolbar icons

  - round icons for plants (SVG over raster image)

  - change order of layers in list (#478)

  - show all editable plant attributes (#476)

  - format of english/german name of plants in search

  - show preview of plant and relations while placing (icon moves with cursor on canvas and connecting lines are shown)

  - Toast messages show success but errors more rarely

  - Typical editor keybindings

  - touch screen improvements

  - title attributes on toolbar icons

  - highlight plant placement mode with color

- Plants areas as one entity on canvas
- Scaling vs area of plants
- Potential low performance of SSE with many users
- Sprint plan:

  Done:

  - Maps connected to owning user through authentication token

  - Plant API reworked and uses layer id instead of map id

  - fixed a rounding error in planting coordinates while moving

  Next Steps:

  - Complete fix for CORS issues

  - Keycloak mailing

  - Documentation of infrastructure (variables, services, timeoutes)

  - Complete plant/map search

  - Implement relations and fill with curated data

  - API for plant heatmap

  - Reduce DB model to only used columns

  - Automatic NC directories for maps and layers

  - Improve UI and app usability

  - Complete base layer

  - Map edit/duplicate

  - Implement Blossoms

- Only push package-lock.json on deliberate package updates/additions
- Increment version number on deliberate changes of package-lock.json
- Edit fields should push changes seamlessly with debounce instead of submit button
