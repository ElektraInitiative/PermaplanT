- Level 2: Fix in next version
- Level 3: Correction will be done opportunistically
- Level 4: Correction planning is still open

## Closing remarks

- How is the current state of the software?
- Have the quality objectives been achieved?
- What are the consequences drawn from the current state, including: how can future errors be avoided, how can the development process be improved?
