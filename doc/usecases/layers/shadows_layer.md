# Use Case: Shadows Layer

## Summary

- **Scope:** Shadow Layer
- **Level:** User Goal
- **Actors:** App User
- **Brief:** The user can add, edit, move and delete shadow areas in their map in the shadow layer and adjust the intensity.
- **Status:** Draft

## Scenarios

- **Precondition:**
  The user has opened the app and has selected the shadow layer.
- **Main success scenario:**
  The user successfully adds, edits, moves and deletes shadow areas in their map in the shadow layer.
  This includes positioning the indicators in areas of the landscape that receive more or less sun exposure and adjusting the intensity of the shadow area.
  Shadow areas can be added by a big brush to draw on the shadow layer.
- **Alternative scenario:**
  The user accidentally adds or moves a shadow area in the wrong location and uses the app's undo function to correct the mistake.
- **Error scenario:**
  The user attempts to add or edit a shadow area but the app is experiencing technical difficulties and is unable to complete the request, displaying an error message.
- **Postcondition:**
  The user's map includes the added, edited, moved or deleted shadow area as desired.
- **Non-functional Constraints:**
  - Performance: Map sizes with more than 1ha in 10000 raster elements (mÂ²) per year should be usable without noticeable delays and acceptable memory overhead
