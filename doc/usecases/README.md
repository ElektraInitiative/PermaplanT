# Usecases

This folder contains all use cases of PermaplanT.

They are structured in folders by progress:

- `draft`: not yet ready for implementation
- `assigned`: use case is part of PermaplanT 1.0
- `current`: use case is currently worked on
- `done`: use case was successfully implemented

## Done

A use case is done iff:

- documentation: clear for others how changes/extensions should be done
- issues closed or written about left-overs in notes of use case
- write in Changelog about finished UC and add a link to it
- extend the [test protocol](../tests/manual/protocol.md)
- add links from use case to implementation/documentation/test protocol
- move use case to folder "done"
