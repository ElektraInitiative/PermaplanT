- **Error scenario:**
  The host does not have a location set: An error message is displayed,
  which informs them that the location is required for sending invitations.
- **Postcondition:**

  - The user without location gets a notification which informs them about the event (e.g. invitation to visit the map virtually) 
  with the additional text that they get the invitation because they don't have a location set.
