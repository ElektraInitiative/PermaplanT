# Use Case: Search Plants

## Summary

- **Scope:** Plants Layer
- **Level:** User Goal
- **Actors:** App User
- **Brief:** The user can search for plants to add to her map and sort results by different criterion.
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Assignee:** Gabriel

## Scenarios

- **Precondition:**
  - The user is logged in to the app.
  - The plants layer or seed entry dialog is shown.
- **Main success scenario:**
  - The user types something into the search text box.  
    This will search for partial matches of actual plants (not higher ranks) in:
    - Unique name
    - German common names
    - English common names
    - Attributes that describe the plant, especially `edible_uses`, so that people can search for `popcorn`.
    - Furthermore, other columns can be matched with extra syntax (e.g. environmental fit or ecological value)
  - Results then get extended by the whole hierarchy below, e.g., a search for `Tomato` should include all cultivars.
  - The results are ranked by:
    1. Exact matches, without additional letters before or after, e.g. the user wrote "fir", "fir" should be first hit
    2. Language settings, e.g., when typing "fi" on English setting "fir" should rank higher than German "Fichte"
       (and the other way round)
    3. Names of a plant should be preferred (over text found in attributes or plants found of the hierarchy below).
  - The resulting list is constructed (e.g., Tomatillo _Physalis philadelphica_):
    - common names according to language settings (German or English), if available, then
    - a hyphen `-` (if there was a common name), then
    - unique name rendered as described in [hierarchy description](doc/database/hierarchy.md)
  - The matched part of the text should be bold.
- **Alternative scenario:**
- **Error scenario:**
  - No match can be found for what the user was searching for.  
    A message will be displayed that nothing was found.
- **Postcondition:**
  - The user has found the plant or a similar one to add to her map.
- **Non-functional Constraints:**
  - Performance
  - If there is a possible match in the database, it should be included (regardless of language settings etc.)
  - Search accuracy (stop words, stemming, etc.)
