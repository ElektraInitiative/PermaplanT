## Summary

- **Scope:** All Layers
- **Level:** User Goal
- **Actors:** App User

- **Status:** Assigned
- **Assignee:** Giancarlo

## Scenarios

- **Precondition:**
  User has opened the app and has multiple layers available to view.
- **Main success scenario:**
  User successfully changes the visibility of layers in their map by selecting the desired layers and can toggle the visibility:
  - on (elements and colors on layer are fully visible)
  - transparent (elements and colors on layer are transparent)
  - off (nothing from the layer is visible
- **Alternative scenario:**
  - On activation of a layer, also the visibility gets turned on.
  - On activation of some layers, the visibility of others layer changes; e.g.,
    activation of the [moisture layer](moisture_layer.md) also sets the visibility of the [infrastructure layer](layers/infrastructure_layer.md) to on.
- **Error scenario:**
  The user attempts to toggle the visibility but the app is experiencing technical difficulties and is unable to complete the request, displaying an error message.
- **Postcondition:**
  The user has changed the visibility of the selected layer.
