# Feasibility Study for Visualizing and Rasterizing 5D Data (x, y, z, time, alternative) in QGIS

## Introduction
This feasibility study aims to assess the possibility of creating, visualizing and rasterizing a table with 5D data (x, y, z, time, alternative) using QGIS, a popular open-source geographic information system (GIS) software. Based on the research it, the best course of action for visualizing the data in a 2D map and rasterizing the data will be determined.

### 1. 5D Data Table
A 5D data table contains five dimensions: spatial (x, y, z), temporal (time), and alternative scenarios (alternative). Spatial dimensions (x, y, z) represent the location in a three-dimensional space, while the time dimension refers to the temporal aspect of the data. The alternative dimension represents various scenarios for the data points.

### 1.1 Feasibility
Creating a 5D data table is feasible using a combination of GIS data formats and databases. PostgreSQL, an open-source relational database management system, can be extended using PostGIS to store and manage geospatial data including 3D and time-based data. The alternative dimension can be stored as an additional attribute in the table. QGIS supports PostGIS connections that allow users to query and visualize the data.

### 2. Visualizing 5D Data in QGIS
QGIS supports 3D visualization and time-based data, but visualizing the alternative dimension could be more challenging.

### 2.1 Feasibility

3D Visualization: QGIS has a 3DMap view that allows users to visualize and explore 3D data (x, y, z) on a 3D canvas. 

Time-based data: QGIS has a temporal controller for visualizing and managing time-based data, enabling users to animate and analyze data changes over time.
    
    
Alternative scenarios: Visualizing alternative scenarios simultaneously might not be directly supported in QGIS. However, you can create layers for each alternative scenario and toggle their visibility to compare them.

## 3. Projecting 5D Data to a 2D Map
Projection of 5D data to a 2D map involves simplifying the data to fit the constraints of a 2D representation.

### 3.1 Feasibility

Spatial dimensions (x, y): Projecting x and y coordinates to a 2D map is straightforward in QGIS, as it's the default visualization method.

Elevation (z): You can represent elevation using contour lines or color gradients (e.g., a hillshade layer) to give a sense of the 3D aspect on a 2D map.

Time: A time slider or static snapshots of the data at specific time intervals can represent time-based data on a 2D map.

Alternative scenarios: Different layers or side-by-side maps can be used to compare alternative scenarios on a 2D map.

## 4. Rasterization
Rasterization refers to the conversion of vector data to raster data, usually for faster processing, visualization, or analysis purposes.

### 4.1 Feasibility
Rasterization of 5D data is possible, but it requires some adaptations and limitations.

Spatial dimensions (x, y, z): Rasterizing spatial data is a common process in GIS. However, converting 3D data to raster may require the creation of separate raster layers for each elevation value or an elevation-aware raster format like a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
    Time: Rasterizing time-based data may involve creating a separate raster layer for each time step, resulting in a time-series raster stack. This allows for the analysis and visualization of temporal data as a sequence of raster images.
    Alternative scenarios: Rasterizing alternative scenarios is feasible by creating separate raster layers for each scenario. The raster layers can then be compared and analyzed individually or together.

## 5. Hatched Boxes
Hatched boxes refer to areas or cells in a raster layer that are marked with a pattern to indicate specific conditions or values.

### 5.1 Feasibility
Applying hatched patterns to raster cells in QGIS is possible using the layer styling options. Users can create rule-based styles that apply hatching patterns to cells based on certain conditions or values. This technique can be applied to the raster layers representing elevation, time, or alternative scenarios, depending on the analysis or visualization objectives.

## 6. Spatial SQL Queries in PostGIS Database with Rust's Diesel Library

The Diesel library is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and query builder for Rust, which simplifies the process of interacting with databases. Diesel can be used in conjunction with the "diesel-geography" crate to perform spatial SQL queries on a PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL database.

### 6.1 Feasibility
Using Rust's Diesel library in combination with the "diesel-geography" crate it is feasible to build and execute spatial SQL queries on the 5D data stored in a PostGIS database. This approach enables users to perform complex geospatial analyses and data manipulations using Rust while benefiting from the powerful spatial capabilities of PostGIS.

## Conclusion
This feasbility study concludes that it is possible to create a 5D data table, visualize the data in QGIS, project it onto a 2D map, and rasterize the data. However, some adaptations are needed to represent time and alternative dimensions effectively. Hatched boxes can be used to highlight specific conditions or values in the rasterized data layers.

While QGIS supports 3D visualization and time-based data, visualizing alternative scenarios simultaneously may require a workaround such as using separate layers for each scenario and toggling their visibility. Projecting 5D data to a 2D map involves simplifying data representation using contour lines, color gradients, time sliders, or static snapshots, and comparing alternative scenarios with different layers or side-by-side maps.

Rasterizing 5D data is feasible, but it may require creating separate raster layers for elevation, time steps, and alternative scenarios. Hatched boxes can be applied in QGIS using layer styling options to indicate specific conditions or values in raster data.

Overall, I think the proposed tasks are achievable using QGIS, but some adaptations and workarounds like the ones mentioned before are needed to effectively represent and analyze the complexity of 5D data in a 2D environment.
