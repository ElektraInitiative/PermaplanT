# Search Plants

## Problem

We want to provide a usable search for plants that goes beyond searching for substring in various plant names.
Partial matches of the following fields should be returned.

- Unique name
- Common names
- Edible uses

## Constraints

1. Results should be fetched in a single query in order to utilize pagination.
2. Exact matches should be ranked high.
3. The users language preference should be taken into account when ranking.
4. Matches in names should have a higher rank than those in edible uses.
5. We don't want to add additional databases like Elasticsearch or [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/).

## Assumptions

1. Postgres will perform reasonable with these search queries.
2. Using postgres or even extension specific functions with diesel is possible and maintainable.
3. The plants table stays relatively small (it won't reach millions of rows).
4. The query entered in the search typically has 1-2 words with no more than 4 words.

## Solutions

### Postgres Full Text Search

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html

Postgres provides built in full text search functionality.

Pros:

- Easy to use.
- No additional extensions needed.

Cons:

- No ability to match parts of compound words.
  E.g. Searching for "Kirsche" wouldn't return a row containing "Frühkirsche".
- Built in ranking works by count the occurrences of matched words in a document.
- Seems better suited for searching through large text documents.

### Partial Match With String Distance

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/fuzzystrmatch.html#id-1.11.7.24.7

Here a match would be found with an `ILIKE` query and the results ranked by measuring
the Levenshtein distance between the query string and the matched word in the column.
This distance describes the number of character changes required to transform one string
into the other.
A language-preference based factor can be applied to the rank depending on the language
of the matched column.

Pros:

- Very precise matching with very few irrelevant results.
- Computationally simple and fast.

Cons:

- Wouldn't be able to catch typos.
- May miss relevant results where only a part of the strings match.
  E.g. a search for "Frühkirsche" would not return "Spätkirsche".

### Partial Match With String Similarity

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html#id-1.11.7.44.6

A match can be found by using the string similarity operator `%` from the `pg_trgm` extension.
This similarity is calculated by counting the number of shared trigrams between the strings.
Pairs that have a similarity above a certain threshold would be matched.
A trigram is a sequence of three consecutive characters in a string.
This similarity can further be used to calculate a ranking in a similar manner as described
in [string distance](#partial-match-with-string-distance).

Pros:

- Ability to handle spelling mistakes in the query string·
- Loose matching mechanism returns related results.
  E.g. a search for "Frühkirsche" would also return "Spätkirsche".

Cons:

- Can produce very many results for short query strings.
- Computationally more expensive than other options.
  Can be alleviated by creating an index on the relevant columns.
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html#id-1.11.7.44.8
- Less useful for very long query strings as there will be fewer common trigrams.

## Decision

Given the constrains and assumptions Partial Match with String Similarity (pg_trgm) seems to be the best option for us.

## Rationale

As there is a relatively small number of rows and search terms performance isn't that much of an issue.  
As of writing this pg_trgm executes almost instantly in a 'search as you type' fashion.

The ability to handle spelling mistakes and loose matches is also great for us as plant names can be somewhat complicated to spell.

Generally it is seems to fit best for our usecase.
Something like elasticsearch could cover the usecase better, however it adds a lot of complexity.

## Implications

The following points are difficult if not impossible to implement using PostgreSQL.  
Before trying them it should be evaluated if a different database like elasticsearch might be a better fit for this usecase.

- Other columns can be matched with extra syntax (e.g. environmental fit or ecological value).
  - This can be quite difficult when parsing the query yourself as you would have to 'invent' a query language.
  - As an example: `amarena cherry water_requirement = dry` might work as you know that `water_requirement = dry` those belong together.
  - However: `amarena cherry alternate_name = Pacific silver fir` doesn't work as it isn't clear which parts of `Pacific silver fir` belong to `alternate_name` an which parts don't. This is a somewhat cherry picked example, but there might be other problem like that we have to consider.
  - Apart from that it isn't simple to add new where clauses to a query as we would have to parse the users input and at the same time prevent SQL injections (which isn't trivial).
- Search in hierarchy is difficult
- Search accuracy (stop words, stemming, etc.)
