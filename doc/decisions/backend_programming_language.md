# Backend Programming Language

## Problem

When selecting a backend programming language, a major issue is the range of options available, each with its own strengths and capabilities.
This makes it challenging to determine the best language for a particular project or application.

## Constraints

- The language and its ecosystem must be free software.
- The language must be performant.
- The code must be easily maintainable.
- Scalability
- Security
- Availability of developers and support

## Assumptions

## Considered Alternatives

- Kotlin
- Python
- JavaScript

## Decision

We will use **stable** Rust version 1.67.1 (2023-02-09), installed by `rustup`, as the backend programming language for PermaplanT.

## Rationale

Rust has a growing community of developers and a robust ecosystem of libraries and tools, which can make it easier to build and maintain backend applications.
Overall, Rust's combination of performance, safety, and support make it a viable option for backend development.
