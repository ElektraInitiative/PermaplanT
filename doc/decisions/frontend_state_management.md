# Frontend State Management

## Problem

PermaplanT is a web application built with React that requires efficient and flexible state management.
Inside a React application we can usually distinguish between three types of state:

1. Local Component State: Is the dropdown open or not, is the link active or not, and so on.
2. Global Application State (Synchronous): Local user preferences, Sidenav is open, UI state in a visual design app.
3. Server State (Asynchronous): A network request is needed before any state can be derived.

## Constraints

- The state management library must support React and work seamlessly with the rest of the application's technology stack.
- The library should be well-maintained, have a large community of developers, and a good documentation.

## Considered Alternatives

### Global Application State

- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
  Requires more complex setup, boilerplate and has a steeper learning curve than Zustand.
- [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
  Requires complex custom state management solution for complex application
- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/)
  Requires basic understanding of reactive programming - may otherwise lead to inconsistencies and performance problems.
- [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)
  Recoil is still in experimental state, not yet recommended for production (16.03.2023).

### Server State

- [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr)
  Fewer features than React Query

## Decision

### Local Component State

No library is needed.

Managing component state can be accomplished with React features (useState, Context + useReducer).

### Global Application State

[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) will be used as the global state management library for PermaplanT.

Zustand is a lightweight and easy-to-use library that uses hooks, which makes it easy to integrate with React.
Its simplicity also reduces the amount of boilerplate code and the need for complex setup and configuration.

### Server State

[React Query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/) will be used for managing asynchronous state.

React Query is a feature rich, up-to-date library for managing asynchronous data.
