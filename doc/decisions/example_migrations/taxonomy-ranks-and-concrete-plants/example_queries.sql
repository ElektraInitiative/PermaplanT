--
-- Example: Relationships
--
-- For this example we use the following notation
-- companion "<->"
-- antagonist ">-<"
-- Consider the following relationships between plants:
-- Radish <-> carrot
-- Radish <-> potato
-- Carrot >-< potato
-- Marigold <-> carrot
-- Marigold <-> radish
--
-- We want to plant carrots and radish and get suggestions for it.
-- When looking for companions we would expect the result just to be marigold.
-- Potato wouldn't be in the result since it's an antagonist to carrot.
--
-- Let's insert the plants.
-- insert carrot
