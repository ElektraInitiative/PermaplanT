# Performance Benchmarks

## Requirements

The following tools are required to run the benchmarks:

- docker
- [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) (e.g. via `cargo install nu`)
- perf (package might be called `linux-perf-5.10`)
- [flamegraph](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) (cargo install flamegraph)
- [httperf](https://github.com/httperf/httperf)
- `jq`
- `psql` (part of PostgreSQL)
- standard linux tools like `grep`, `awk` etc.

## Setup

Add the following to the end of `backend/Cargo.toml`.
This is necessary to ensure that perf can accurately track the function stack.

```toml
[profile.release]
debug = true
```

The `benchmarks/backend/*/setup.sh` scripts contain `PERF=/usr/lib/linux-tools/5.4.0-153-generic/perf` to set the location of perf.
Depending on your distribution it might or might not be needed to change this.
On Debian no change is needed.
Otherwise modify the path to point to your `perf` installation.

## Scripts

You can find the scripts in `benchmark/backend/`.
They are supposed to be run from the repositories root folder.

The subfolders contain scripts to run performance benchmarks in specific endpoints.

### `setup.sh`

Execute like the following:  
`./benchmarks/backend/<endpoint>/setup.sh <username> <password>`.

It will start the database and backend.
Depending on the endpoint it might execute `insert_data.sh` scripts to insert additional data into the database.

The script might output instructions while executing.
Follow these instructions to ensure the benchmark works correctly.

Parameters:

- username: Your PermaplanT username for https://auth.permaplant.net.
- password: Your PermaplanT password.

### `run_httperf.sh`

Execute like the following:  
`./benchmarks/backend/<endpoint>/run_httperf.sh <username> <password> <number_of_requests> <request_rate>`.

This script shall be run as soon as the `setup.sh` starts the backend via `cargo flamegraph`.  
It will execute requests on the backend using httperf.

Once this script finishes you can interrupt `setup.sh` via Ctrl+C.
Note that it might take 20min or longer to finish once interrupted.
Do not press Ctrl+C again, otherwise the generated flamegraph will not include all data.

Parameters:

- username: Your PermaplanT username for https://auth.permaplant.net.
- password: Your PermaplanT password.
- number_of_requests: The total number of requests httperf will execute (e.g. 10000).
- request_rate: How many requests will be executed per second (e.g. 100).

### `get_statistics.sh`

Execute like the following:  
`./benchmarks/backend/<endpoint>/get_statistics.sh`.

This script shall be executed once all previous scripts finished.  
It will parse the PostgreSQL logs and httperf logs to extract execution times.

## Example run

The following is a step by step guide on how to execute the benchmark for the heatmap:

1. Insert
   ```toml
    [profile.release]
    debug = true
   ```
   into `Cargo.toml`.
2. Execute: `./benchmarks/backend/heatmap/setup.sh <username> <password>`. Do the following once the script gives the instructions.
   - Start the backend in dev mode.
   - Press Enter.
   - Select map size: press `s`.
   - Stop the backend.
   - Press Enter.
3. Wait for the backend to start in release mode.
4. Once its started execute in a second shell: `./benchmarks/backend/heatmap/run_httperf.sh <username> <password> 100 10`
5. Wait for httperf to finish.
6. Press Ctrl+C in the `setup.sh` shell.
7. Wait until `flamegraph.svg` was generated (this might take 20min or longer).
   If you interrupt this step you have to rerun the benchmark.
8. Execute: `./benchmarks/backend/heatmap/get_statistics.sh`
9. Collect results:
   - flamgraph.svg
   - Copy request execution times and query execution times from stdout of `get_statistics.sh`
