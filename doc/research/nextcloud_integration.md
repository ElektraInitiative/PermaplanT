## webDAV

> "WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a set of extensions to the
> Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which allows user agents to collaboratively
> author contents directly in an HTTP web server by providing facilities for concurrency
> control and namespace operations, thus allowing Web to be viewed as a writeable,
> collaborative medium and not just a read-only medium."
> [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV)

### testing with cadaver

opening a connection

```bash
cadaver
open https://nextcloud.markus-raab.org/nextcloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/Documents
```

type help for a list of commands

```bash
help
```

## calendar

Nextcloud Calendar App is a frontend for the Nextcloud CalDAV backend.

## contacts, circles, groups

Contacts and Circles are two different apps in Nextcloud.
Contacts and Groups are stored in vCards and can be managed with CardDAV.

The circle app has a REST API but it is not documented. The routes of the API can be found in
https://github.com/nextcloud/circles/blob/22238597fb9045e748119247fceaac7321f0a31e/appinfo/routes.php

API test with curl (USERNAME, PSWD and BASE_URL have to set):

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PSWD -X GET 'https://BASE_URL/nextcloud/ocs/v2.php/apps/circles/circles' -H "OCS-APIRequest: true"
```

This returns a list of circles visible to the authenticated user.

Working API calls (tested with NC version 25.0.4-1~deb11):

- add member

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PSWD -X POST 'https://BASE_URL/nextcloud/ocs/v2.php/apps/circles/circles/CIRCLE_ID/members/multi' -H "OCS-APIRequest: true" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"members":[{"id":"USER_ID","type":1}]}'
```

- create circle

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PSWD -X POST 'https://BASE_URL/nextcloud/ocs/v2.php/apps/circles/circles' -H "OCS-APIRequest: true" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"test_circle_3","personal":false,"local":false}'
```

- delete member from circle

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PSWD -X DELETE 'https://BASE_URL/nextcloud/ocs/v2.php/apps/circles/circles/CIRCLE_ID/members/MEMBER_ID' -H "OCS-APIRequest: true"
```

- get circles

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PSWD -X GET 'https://BASE_URL/nextcloud/ocs/v2.php/apps/circles/circles' -H "OCS-APIRequest: true"
```

- get members

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PSWD -X GET 'https://BASE_URL/nextcloud/ocs/v2.php/apps/circles/circles/CIRCLE_ID/members' -H "OCS-APIRequest: true"
```

nextcloud/contacts implements CardDAV:

> "vCard Extensions to WebDAV (CardDAV) is an address book client/server
> protocol designed to allow users to access and share contact data on a server.
> CardDAV is based on WebDAV, which is based on HTTP, and it uses vCard for contact data.[2]"
> [wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV)

nextcloud/contacts is based on [sabredav](https://github.com/sabre-io/dav)(most popular WebDAV framework for PHP)

## maps

The maps Nextcloud plugin offers a REST API. The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/maps/blob/master/openapi.yml).

The GET endpoint /favorite was tested with curl and basic authentication:

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PSWD -X GET 'https://BASE_URL/nextcloud/index.php/apps/maps/api/1.0/favorites'
```

## Chat

sending a message:

```rust,ignore
// sends once, Err if it does not work on network or nextcloud level
fn send_message (
	&self,
	message: String,
	chat: String,
) -> Result<reqwest::Response, reqwest::Error> {
	let mut headers = header::HeaderMap::new();
	headers.insert("Content-Type", "application/json".parse().unwrap());
	headers.insert("Accept", "application/json".parse().unwrap());
	headers.insert("OCS-APIRequest", "true".parse().unwrap());

	let result = reqwest::Client::new()
		.post(&format!(
			"{}/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v1/chat/{}",
			&self.url, chat
		))
		.basic_auth(&self.user, self.pass.as_ref())
		.headers(headers)
		.body(format!(
			"{{\"token\": \"{}\", \"message\": \"{}\"}}",
			chat, message
		))
		.send();
	match result {
		Ok(response) => match response.error_for_status() {
			Ok(response) => Ok(response),
			Err(error) => Err(error),
		},
		Err(error) => Err(error),
	}
}
```

or via CURL:

```bash
curl -sS -d "{\"token\": \"$CHAT\", \"message\": \"$*\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "OCS-APIRequest: true" -u "user:password" https://nextcloud.markus-raab.org/nextcloud/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v1/chat/$CHAT
```
