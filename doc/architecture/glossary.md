# Glossary

## Basics

- PermaplanT:
  the planning app implemented in this repository
- map:
  The main planning utility for PermaplanT, which contains _elements_ in several _layers_.
- Nextcloud map:
  A Nextcloud app which is used as overview where which garden is, see [here](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/maps).
- version (of a map):
  A version (of a map) is a named snapshot of a map at a certain point in time while working on that map.
  It is possible to switch to a different version of a layer.
  It is similar to the undo-redo feature with the difference that the snapshots:
  - are persistent
  - have a name and
  - any specific snapshot can be selected.
- offline:
  Means the ability to use a feature without Internet connection, i.e., without calling REST APIs.
- canvas:
  The main and middle part of the screen which provides the planning/drawing functionality.
- elements (of a map in a layer):
  Can be drawn or added to the map via drag and drop.
  They have _attributes_.

## Biology

- seedproof (German: Samenfest):
  From the seeds of a fruit you get again similar fruits.
- raising (German: Anzucht, vorziehen)
- (German: Vorkulturen)
- Rank:
  Rank is a level within taxonomy.
  There are:
  - Variety (optional)
  - Species or Hybrid
  - Genus
  - Subfamily (optional)
  - Family
- Variety:
  Has the main characteristics of its species but differs in minor heritable characteristics.
- Hybrid:
  Resulting individual from cross-pollination of species or varieties.
- Traits:
- (German: Sortenrein, ohne/wenig Vermischung anderer Sorten, wenig/keine Fremdbest√§ubung)
- attributes (of plants):
  A characteristic of a variety, species, genus, subfamily or family.
  E.g. height, width, color, etc.
  Attributes can be defined on different levels of the hierarchy.
  E.g. a variety can have a different height than the species it belongs to.
- polyculture (aka companion planting, German: Mischkultur):
  Mutually beneficial way of growing plants together.
- relationship:
  Two plants are in a non-neutral relationship if they either enhance (companion)
  or diminish (antagonist) each others health and growth.
- companion (to plant according polyculture):
  Plants that should be planted together.
- antagonist (to plant according polyculture):
  Plants that should be avoided next to each other.
- Zone (in permaculture, German: Permakultur Zonen):
  Is an area which has the same frequency of human visitors.
  The areas are numbered from:
  - 00 (represented numerically as -1)
  - 0: physical body of permaculturist
  - 1: extremely frequently visited
  - 2: frequently visited
  - 3: less frequently visited
  - 4: rarely visited
  - 5: usually not visited
  - 6: never visited/protection zone

## Layers

- enable (a layer):
  Changes the canvas in a way that _elements_ in the enabled layer are the ones to be edited, selected and added.
  When working together on a map, every user can enable the layer of their choice.
- visibility and opacity (of a layer):
  The elements in a layer are (not) shown or with a user-selected transparency.
- alternative (of a layer):
  An alternative (of a layer) is a named clone of a layer.
  It is possible to _select_ one alternative of a layer.
  Each alternative can be edited independently.
- select (a layer):
  To choose one alternative of one layer.
  E.g. if there are several plant layers, a user can select only one of these alternatives at once.
  When working together on a map, every user can select their own layers.
- offline availability:
  Means that layers can be edited also offline, data gets synced when device is online again.
