## Incorporate Accessibility Best Practices

Writing code that is highly accessible and easily testable should be a priority whenever possible.
While it may not always be the primary focus, if you can achieve both goals simultaneously, it's worth pursuing that path.
Additionally, many accessibility best practices are inherent in standard coding practices, such as using appropriate HTML elements like h1s, button tags, and providing alt attributes for images.

Ensure proper labeling of form elements, provide alternative text for images, and use appropriate ARIA [roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#roles) and [attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-attributes) to enhance [accessibility](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).
