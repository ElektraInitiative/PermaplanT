# Versioning

We increment the frontend version number:

- on any deployment on `www.permaplant.net`
- to be sure that newest version of `dev.permaplant.net` is present (e.g. for beta tests)
- on any change in `frontend/package.json`

An updated frontend version number should lead to discarding all caches on clients.
