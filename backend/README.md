# PermaplanT Backend

## Requirements

- Rust 1.67.1 or later ([Installation guide](../doc/development_setup.md))
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) version 13 or later
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker) (run the container, but change the port to 8081)
- libpq-dev
- libssl-dev
- pkg-config

## Installation

1. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and enter the data according to your setup.

- `DATABASE_URL` is the Connection [URI](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) to your PostgreSQL database
- `BIND_ADDRESS_HOST` defines the host on which the server will run on
- `BIND_ADDRESS_PORT` defines the port on which the server will run on
- `AUTH_DISCOVERY_URI` the .well-known endpoint of the auth server (see [RFC 8414](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html#section-2) for more detail)
- `AUTH_CLIENT_ID` the client id the frontend should use to log in
- `RUST_LOG` used to set the logging config for [env_logger](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/)

Ensure that you grant the necessary permissions for the user to use Postgres. One way to do this is by using the following command:

```shell
sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE USER permaplant WITH CREATEDB PASSWORD 'permaplant';
```

2. Install Diesel CLI:

```shell
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
```

3. Run the diesel setup, this makes sure that diesel will create the database if it doesn't exist yet and will run all migrations.

```shell
LC_ALL=C diesel setup
```

4. Run diesel migrations, to bring the database up to date with the current schema.

```shell
LC_ALL=C diesel migration run
```

5. Install the typeshare cli to enable type safety between Rust and TypeScript:

```shell
cargo install typeshare-cli
```

6. Start Keycloak

You can do one of the following two steps, the first one being the simpler one, but with less configuration options.

- To use the preconfigured Keycloak instance simply copy the newest version of `.env.sample` to `.env`
- To use the local Keycloak variant follow the steps in [/doc/setups/keycloak/](/doc/setups/keycloak/README.md)  
  You then also have to change following two env variables in `.env`
  - `AUTH_DISCOVERY_URI=http://localhost:8081/realms/PermaplanT/.well-known/openid-configuration`
  - `AUTH_CLIENT_ID=PermaplanT`

7. Run the backend

```bash
cargo run
```

### Test server using Swagger

- Go to <http://localhost:8080/doc/api/swagger/ui/>.  
  If you try to execute a request now it should return error 401.
- Click `Authorize`.

- Use the `authorizationCode` auth flow.
- Enter client_id `swagger-ui` (client_secret is empty) and click `Authorize`.
- Enter user credentials (username: `test`, password: `test`).
- You should now be able to execute a request in Swagger.
