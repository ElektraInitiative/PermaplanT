# PermaplanT Frontend

## Requirements

- nodejs 19.4.0 ([Installation guide](../doc/development_setup.md))
- npm

## Installation and Usage

1. Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

2. Generate backend types via TypeShare.
   Make sure that the typeshare-cli is installed in the backend.

```shell
npm run generate-api-types
```

3. Create '.env' file and copy content from '.env.sample'.
   Modify env variables to fit the environment.

```shell
cp .env.sample .env
```

4. Start development server

```shell
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) and will open the application in your default web browser.
The server will automatically reload the page when you make changes to the code.

## Documentation

To view the documentation

1. Generate the documentation via TypeDoc.

```shell
npm run doc
```

2. Start storybook

```shell
npm run storybook
```

This will start the storybook dev server on [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/) and will open it up on your default web browser.

## Testing

1. Make sure you are in the frontend directory
2. Run the test script

```shell
npm run test
```

### Testing individual files

```shell
npm run test -- path/to/component.test.tsx
```

### Watch mode

Our test framework provides an interactive watch mode that can be executed with

```shell
npm run test -- --watchAll
```

This command starts an interactive CLI that can be used to rerun specific tests after implementing changes.

## Production

To build the application for production, run:

```shell
npm run build
```

By default, the build output will be placed at `dist`.

To view the build locally, run:

```shell
npm run preview
```

## Type Safety

In order to ensure type safety between the TypeScript frontend and Rust backend, we use [typeshare](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare) to synchronize our Rust type definitions with TypeScript.
These types are auto-generated and we can find our rust-typescript bindings under `/src/bindings` and use them directly in our TypeScript codebase.
